What kind of tool or ui design is it when you have tooltips that guide the user through interactive screens in order to onboard them to a new software? 

\>>
The feature you're describing is commonly referred to as a "user onboarding tour" or "interactive walkthrough." It's a sequence of tooltips and overlays that guide the user step-by-step through the user interface of a new software to help them understand its main features and functionalities. The primary goal is to improve the user experience by providing contextual help during the onboarding process, ensuring users can effectively and efficiently use the software.

Here are some common characteristics and elements of user onboarding tours:

1. **Tooltips**: These provide contextual information about specific UI elements. They usually point to a particular button, field, or other interface elements and describe its function.

2. **Overlays**: Sometimes the whole screen or a large part of it will be covered, focusing the user's attention on a specific section of the page. 

3. **Arrows and Highlights**: These are used to draw attention to specific parts of the UI.

4. **Progress Indicators**: Many onboarding tours show users their progress through the tour, like "Step 3 of 7."

5. **Navigation Controls**: These allow users to move back and forth between steps, or skip the tour entirely.

6. **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: After explaining a feature, there might be a prompt for the user to try it out, reinforcing the learning experience.

A few popular tools and libraries used to create such onboarding experiences include:

- **Intro.js**: A lightweight library to create step-by-step user onboarding tours.
- **WalkMe**: A digital adoption platform that allows the creation of interactive onboarding tours.
- **UserGuiding**: A platform for creating interactive product tours, user onboarding guides, and in-app messaging.
- **Joyride**: Often used with React applications to create guided tours.

Remember, while these tours can be very useful, they should be used judiciously. Overwhelming a user with too much information at once can be counterproductive. It's also a good idea to provide an option for users to skip or exit the tour if they wish.
