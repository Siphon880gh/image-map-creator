By Weng Fei Fung

Create image with clickable regions that you can add to your website.

<u>Or</u> create a series of screenshots to onboard new users to your website in a walkthrough tour.

## Demo

[Try it out now!](https://wengindustries.com/app/image-map-creator)


## Extra Features

- Add a caption to the image map. Toggle it to overlay the image or to be directly north of the image.
- Set if a region only opens link when you right-click or left-click. 
This allows you to onboard users when there's a right-click context menu involved. Screenshot 1 would have the app or website. User right clicks a specific area as instructed, then Screenshot 2 will be a screenshot of the app or website but with the context menu. Screenshot 2's context menu will have a clickable region.
- Userflow Walkthrough presentations have logic that renders md files of links quickly so you can have a nice table of contents or reference page to the walkthroughs. Supports nested md lists and renders them as collapsible/toggleables.
- You can cancel out of the current image by pressing Escape.

## Future Version

- In a walkthrough, there will be pre-caching of the next image when the current image is done loading. This will make the app more performant to the user.
- Responsive image maps that would resize down to a phone, although the use case for this is very limited.
